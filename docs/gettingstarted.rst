The pyworkout-toolkit is a Python package that provides tools for post-workout analysis of data or telemetry. The majority of the tools cater to coaches and invidividuals who wish to utilize the data to generate metrics or exercise machine learning/data mining. The toolkit provides parsing of the popular .TCX and .GPX formats, along with some general purpose functions that help preprocess the data for metrics, visualization, or machine learning.
